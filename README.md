## Work Breakdown
In my analysis I used different query techniques to answer business questions such as :
- Which employees are the most performant?
- Which genre sells the most tracks?
- Which county has the most sales?
- Which artist is the most popular?
- Is the range of tracks in the store reflective of their sales popularity?
