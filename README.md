# Answering Chinook Business Questions using SQL

## Task
In this project I have been working with data of Chinook, a music store operating in
many countries and performed analysis on their data to answer business questions such as:
- How many tracks per genre have been sold?
- Which employees are more performant?
- Which countries make the most sales?
- Which artist is the most used in playlists?
- Is the range of tracks in the store reflective of their sales popularity?
- How is the proportion albums vs. individual tracks purchases?

The project is proposed by the e-learning plattform [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) 
which provided the database as an SQLite file named chinook.db.


## Work Breakdown
In my analysis I answered the questions listed above using advanced query techniques such as :
- WITH Clause
- CASE Statement
- Multiple Joins
- Multiple Subqueries
- Combining Rows with EXCEPT 
- Aggregation
